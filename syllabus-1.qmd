### **Academic Honesty Policy Summary:**

In addition to skills and knowledge, Saint Paul College aims to teach students appropriate Ethical and Professional Standards of Conduct. The Academic Honesty Policy exists to inform students and Faculty of their obligations in upholding the highest standards of professional and ethical integrity.

All your quizzes and exams must be done independently with no help from anyone. Make sure you copy the code of honor statement below and send me an email with your name and date of the time to confirm you adhere to this course policy: “I will register for only one account on Mymathlab.com. My answers to homework, quizzes and exams will be my own work (except for assignments that explicitly permit collaboration).

I will not make solutions to homework, quizzes or exams available to anyone else. This includes both solutions written by me, as well as any official solutions provided by the course instructor. I will not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve my results or dishonestly improve/hurt the results of others. Your name. Dated on Jan/…/2023.

### **Special Services and Math Tutoring**

Special Accommodations: It is college policy to provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities. Please contact the office of Disability Resources and Access if you wish to discuss this policy. The Math Center (MC) will be open for drop-in tutoring in room 3125. This tutoring is FREE and no appointment is necessary.

### **Online coursework Integrity Declaration**

Online submission of, or placing one’s name on an exam, assignment, or any course document is a statement of academic honor that the student has not received or given inappropriate assistance in completing it and that the student has complied with the Academic Honesty Policy in that work.

### **Consequences**

An instructor may impose a sanction on the student that varies depending upon the instructor’s evaluation of the nature and gravity of the offense. Possible sanctions include but are not limited to, the following: (1) Require the student to redo the assignment; (2) Require the student to complete another assignment; (3) Assign a grade of zero to the assignment; (4) Assign a final grade of “F” for the course.
